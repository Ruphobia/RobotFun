langchain - LangChain is a framework and collection of tools designed for building applications that leverage
large language models (LLMs), such as those developed by OpenAI (e.g., GPT models). It aims to simplify
the process of integrating these powerful language models into various applications, making it easier for 
developers to create sophisticated AI-powered features. LangChain provides components for conversational 
agents, information retrieval, and more, enabling developers to harness the capabilities of LLMs for a wide 
range of use cases, from automating customer support to generating creative content.

RAG - RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a framework that combines the strengths of 
retrieval-based and generative approaches for natural language processing tasks. It enhances 
the capabilities of generative models by dynamically retrieving relevant context or information 
from a large corpus or database during the generation process. This approach allows the model to 
produce responses or content that is informed by real-world knowledge, making it particularly 
useful for tasks such as question answering, text completion, and content generation where accuracy 
and relevance of information are critical.

The RAG architecture typically involves two main components:

    A retriever that searches a document collection or database to find relevant information based 
    on the input query or prompt. This component is responsible for identifying and fetching content 
    that might be useful for generating the response.
    A generator that produces the final output based on the input prompt and the information retrieved 
    by the retriever. This is usually a large language model like GPT-3, which synthesizes the retrieved 
    information into a coherent and contextually appropriate response.

By leveraging both retrieval and generation, RAG aims to combine the broad knowledge and relevance 
of retrieval-based methods with the fluency and expressiveness of generative models, offering a 
powerful tool for creating AI systems that can provide more accurate, informative, and contextually relevant outputs.
