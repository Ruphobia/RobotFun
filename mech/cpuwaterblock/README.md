### Mounting bracket for 50mm CPU water block

The mounting bracket is intended to adapt a universal 50mm CPU water block from a standard PC to a DELL R820 motherboard.

Water block and copper base are for reference only, not dimension accurate or complete.  We are only working on the mounting plate that is sandwiched in between the water block and the copper base.
